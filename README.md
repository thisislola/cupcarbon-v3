#  CupCarbon v3.8.2

This project belongs entirely to http://cupcarbon.com/ and its authors. 

The program is free to download and the authors also share the source code [here](https://github.com/bounceur/CupCarbon). But since there are no enough updated tutorials for version 5, I had to search everywhere for an ealier version so I could learn how to use the tool. I am sharing what I found in case others are also facing the same issue.

I have added some examples from the site as well (as they were made for v3)

From the website:
> CupCarbon is a Smart City and Internet of Things Wireless Sensor Network (SCI-WSN) simulator. Its objective is to design, visualize, debug and validate distributed algorithms for monitoring, environmental data collection, etc., and to create environmental scenarios such as fires, gas, mobiles, and generally within educational and scientific projects. Not only it can help to visually explain the basic concepts of sensor networks and how they work; it may also support scientists to test their wireless topologies, protocols, etc.  
CupCarbon offers two simulation environments. The first simulation environment enables the design of mobility scenarios and the generation of natural events such as fires and gas as well as the simulation of mobiles such as vehicles and flying objects (e.g. UAVs, insects, etc.). The second simulation environment represents a discrete event simulation of wireless sensor networks which takes into account the scenario designed on the basis of the first environment. [...]
 CupCarbon represents the main kernel of the ANR project PERSEPTEUR that aims to develop algorithms for an accurate simulation of the propagation and interference of signals in a 3D urban environment.
